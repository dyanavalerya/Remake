The alt code, is an initial code made for the functionality of the quizz. It demonstrates functionality but does not have a graphical user interface.

The rest of the code is used for QT, a program we use for the GUI. The serialPortReader and protocol parser is from moodle and is example code from the teacher. The remainder, the main and the dialog code is self made.
